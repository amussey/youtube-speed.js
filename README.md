# youtube-speed.js

Having too many videos embedded on a page can cause slowdowns and degradation of the user experience.  This library replaces the iframed YouTube videos on a page with images that, when clicked, begin playing the video.  This prevents the need to load HTML5 or Flash-based videos until the user actually wants to see them.  This replacement is done completely in-line with no modifications to your existing code.  All you need to do is include the library.

## Installing

Simply include the library in your code:

     <script src="youtube-speed.js"></script>
